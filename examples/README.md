# Zeno Client Examples

The example that is most relevant for all new Zeno users is our [simple_project](./simple_project.ipynb). It demonstrates how Zeno projects can be created, how data can be uploaded, and how system results can be added to a project.

If you have been working with Zeno before our transition to a hosted version, check out our [legacy_upload](./legacy_upload.ipynb) example.
